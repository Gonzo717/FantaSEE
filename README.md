CS 591 Project

# Get Started:
- Android Studio version 3.4.1 or higher
- Android SDK 9 "Pie" (API level 28) or higher
- Latest version of the Android NDK framework  
In Android Studio, go to Preferences > Appearance and Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK  > SDK Tools to download latest Android NDK
- Google Play Service
To install:  Tools > SDK Manager or click SDK Manager > enable google play service
- Before building the app, run Gradle > sdk > Tasks > Build > assemble first, I guess it is used to assemble the NDK

# Bug
- App won't run on emulator, must use physical device to test!

# NOTE
- Oauth will not work since we must add your SHA1 key to our Firebase Console, send us your SHA1 key to test Oauth
